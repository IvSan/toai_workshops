# Project

Create a regression or classification machine learning model on Kaggle or your own dataset.

## Requirements

1. Do exploratory data analysis.
2. Do feature engineering.
3. Do feature preprocessing.
4. Build a machine learning model.
5. Explore your model results.

## Bonus Points

- Move your final model to a Python module.
- Compare multiple machine learning models.
- Do hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model on your own machine.
- Deploy the model on external service.

## Suggestions

- Use scikit-learn for creating the models.
- Use one of these datasets:
  - [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
  - [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
  - [WHO Suicide Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics)
  - [Rain in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
  - [FIFA 19 complete player dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19)
  - [FIFA 18 Complete Player Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset)
  - [Black Friday](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday)
  - [Graduate Admissions](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)
  - [Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
  - [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
  - [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
  - [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Expected Outcome

- Jupyter notebook.

## Presentation

You can present your project during our meetings. You have up to 5 minutes to present, so use this time wisely.
