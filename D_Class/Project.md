# Project

Explore a dataset using explanatory data analysis techniques. You can explore a dataset from Kaggle (competitions or datasets) or a you can use your own dataset.

## Idea

For this project you can choose your own dataset, Kaggle dataset or a dataset from any other source. A lot of people build their datasets scraping the internet. I'd recommend choosing the dataset based on your interests.

## Requirements

1. Use at least 5 charts.
2. Use a pie chart.
3. Use a bar chart.
4. Use a histogram.
5. Use a boxplot.

## Bonus Points

- Add a machine learning model to the analysis.

## Suggestions

- Use Seaborn library for plotting.

## Expected Outcome

- A Jupyter notebook.

## Presentation

You can present your project during our meetings. You have up to 5 minutes to present, so use this time wisely.

## Evaluation
