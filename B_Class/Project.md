# Project

Create a regression, classification or generative deep learning model on Kaggle or your own dataset.

## Requirements

1. Do an exploratory data analysis.
2. Create a data preprocessing pipeline.
3. Do data augmentation.
4. Build a deep learning model using transfer learning and fine-tuning.

## Bonus Points

- Do hyperparameter tuning.
- Compare model accuracy with and without transfer learning.
- Compare accuracy of various model architectures.
- Use multiple inputs.
- Visualize model's activation functions.

## Suggestions

- Use tf.keras for creating the deep learning models.
- Use any dataset from Kaggle with images or use your own dataset.

## Expected Outcome

- Jupyter notebook.

## Presentation

You can present your project during our meetings. You have up to 5 minutes to present, so use this time wisely.

## Evaluation

- [ ] Model performance
